# Ticket-To-Ride
A digital version of the popular strategy board, playable with multiple human or computer players. The cards, score markers, and trains folders contain graphics for the corresponding game pieces. The game is run through the main.gd file, which links all of the other scripts together and defines functions for play. Every script also has a 
tscn file, which is a resource file that can be referenced in different scripts. When a game is started, the player will be prompted to enter the number of human players and 
the number of computer players. Then, colors will randomly be assigned, and the game will begin.
